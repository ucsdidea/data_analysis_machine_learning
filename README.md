# Data Analysis and Machine Learning using Python
Tutorial files for the "Data Analysis and Machine Learning" workshop, presented by the [IDEA Student Center](http://idea.ucsd.edu/) (part of the [Jacobs School of Engineering](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/) of UC San Diego). **NOTE** this workshop is meant as an introduction to data analysis and machine learning, and therefore does not cover everything related to those subjects.

## Requirements
- python
- ipython notebook
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn


## Outline
1) Data Analysis:
- loading common data types (e.g. ``.csv``)
